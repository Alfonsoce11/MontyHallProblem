# MontyHallProblem
I recently found out about the monty hall problem and though it was really interesting. So I decided to make a simulation of it.

NOTE: This is project is not finished. Hopefully I'll be able to finish it within a few days. I just need to finish the simulation, which will probably be the hardest part.
