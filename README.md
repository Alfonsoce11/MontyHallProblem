# MontyHallProblem
I recently found out about the monty hall problem and though it was really interesting. So I decided to make a website about it. It has a home page, a simulation, an explanation, and an about page. I really found the problem interesting since I think it reminds us to to think logically about situations instead of just coming up with intuitive assumptions.
