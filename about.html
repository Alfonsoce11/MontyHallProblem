    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Alfonso Espino. I'm 13 and I'm into coding and engineering stuff. I actually learned about the monty hall problem relatively recently but it really interested me. This is because almost anyone (including me) would intuitively, almost automatically assume that it really doesn't make a difference whether you switch or stay, however if you use logic you can realize that you actually have more information than you thought. It reminds me how we should think logically about things, instead of making intuitive assumptions. I've been wanting to make a project on the monty hall problem for a while, but I finally decided to create it, and also <a href="https://hackclub.com/">hackclub</a> has a YSWS (You Ship We ship) where you can earn ice-cream for creating a website, so I figured why not make this for my submission. It took me a while to understand it so to ensure that I understand it, I figure the best way is by trying to explain it to others. Originally I was just going to make this a simulation but I decided that I should have multiple pages to provide a better site with <a href="explanation.html">my (not very good) explanation</a>, a <a href="simulation.html">simulation</a>, a <a href="index.html">home page</a>, and lastly the about page you are reading right now.</p>
    <p>Here are a few sources I used to help myself understand this:</p>
    <ls>
        <ul><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVq2ivVpZgQ">The video <cite>The Monty Hall Problem</cite> by D!NG</a></ul>
        <ul><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">The wikipedia page</a></ul>
        <ul><a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-monty-hall-problem/"><cite>Understanding the Monty Hall Problem</cite> on Better Explained</a></ul>
        <ul>There are probably a lot more things that I don't remember, that helped me understand it.</ul>
    </ls>
