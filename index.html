    <h1>The Monty Hall Problem</h1>
    <p>The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle based on the game show <cite>Let's Make a Deal</cite> and it's named after the shows original host, Monty Hall. In the problem you are on a game show where there are 3 doors. Behind two of the doors are goats and behind the other is a million dollars. You pick a door, and the game show host, who knows what's behind the doors, always opens a door that you didn't pick that has a goat behind it. The problem is whether you are more likely to win the money if you switch, stay, or if it doesn't make a difference. You can figure this out by testing it out yourself <a href="simulation.html">here</a>, or read my (not very good) explanation <a href="explanation.html">here</a> (or do both). You can also read a little bit about me, why I made this project, why the monty hall problem interests me, and some other sources I used to help myself understand it <a href="about.html">here</a>.</p>
